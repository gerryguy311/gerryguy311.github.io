Breaking Into Cybersecurity Without Experience
Breaking into cybersecurity without experience has never been more achievable than it is right now. There has never been a better time than now to start your journey into cybersecurity. It's projected that there will be over 3.5 million unfilled jobs by the year 2025, with massive opportunities for growth. But one of the problems that catches people right off the rip is the Catch-22 issue of needing experience to get the job, but not being able to get the job to get the experience.

Actionable steps you can take TODAY to start your cybersecurity career journey

So grab a drink, get your notepad ready, and let's dive into how you can break into cybersecurity - even without prior experience.

The Current State of Cybersecurity: Massive Demand, Not Enough Talent
In today's world, we're surrounded by rapidly evolving technology. From new iPhones being announced every few months to VR headsets, autonomous vehicles, electric cars, foldable LED screens, and even IoT toasters - it's a rampant amount of technology. And what does all this tech bring with it? Attack surface.

The advancement of technology will only increase the need for security. As new tech comes out, it has to be accessible, and we have to make sure that the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of that tech is secure.

According to Microsoft, by 2025, there will literally be 3.5 million cybersecurity jobs open globally going unfilled. Even today, in the United States alone, there are nearly half a million unfilled cybersecurity jobs. That's not just an opportunity - that's a wide-open door for those willing to put in the work.

Show Me The Money: What Entry-Level Cybersecurity Jobs Actually Pay
Let's get to the cash money right away - what do you get paid in cybersecurity?

It's not uncommon to get paid anywhere between $60,000 for an entry-level job all the way up to $110,000 for entry-level positions. Now, it will depend quite a bit on where you're living. People in Silicon Valley or New York City are going to get paid higher to do the exact same job as somebody in Omaha, Nebraska. Similarly, the industry makes a difference - people in financial services typically get paid higher than people in education.

According to recent reports, on average, a SOC Analyst - a common entry-level role in the industry - has an average salary of $96,716 USD. There are roughly 11,000 job openings for this particular role alone.

If I'm being real with you, I think a $72,000 starting salary for an entry-level security analyst role with very little experience but a hungry attitude, a willingness to learn, maybe their Security+ certification, and a little bit of demonstrated security acumen is completely reasonable and acceptable. And that's typically a 9-to-5, Monday through Friday type job in most cases.

Types of Entry-Level Cybersecurity Jobs: What They Do and What to Expect
There are tons of cybersecurity jobs out there, but let's focus on the most common entry points:

Cybersecurity Analyst (SOC Analyst)
This is a person who's responsible for protecting an organization's systems, networks, and data from cyber attacks. This role includes tasks such as:

Identifying and assessing security threats (threat modeling)
Monitoring networks for suspicious activity
Responding to security incidents
Conducting regular vulnerability scans to find endpoints with misconfigurations or missing patches
Configuring and maintaining security tools like firewalls, intrusion detection, and EDR solutions
Performing incident response and forensic investigations (the detective side when bad stuff happens)
Staying up-to-date on the latest security threats and technology
The SOC (Security Operations Center) Analyst is often watching for bad stuff to happen and taking action when it does. It's a great entry point because you're exposed to so many different aspects of security, and it's a role where organizations are willing to train the right candidate.

GRC Analyst (Governance, Risk, and Compliance)
These are the people who do things before bad stuff happens. GRC Analysts focus on:

Analyzing policies and procedures to see if they're appropriate
Conducting audits on compliance standards
Informing the business on governance
Assessing risk to determine if controls are sufficient to reduce the threat of actors exploiting the business
GRC roles typically require less technical background, which makes them excellent options if you're transitioning from a non-technical field. You will need to understand some technology, and as you move forward in your career, you'll want to get more comfortable with tech. But it's definitely a pathway that doesn't require you to be a coding wizard or network guru from day one.

I personally came up on the GRC side, and I love it. It combines business acumen with security knowledge, allowing you to make a significant impact on an organization's security posture. That's why I developed the GRC Analyst Master Class at Simply Cyber Academy, which covers every aspect of the GRC analyst role with hands-on labs and practical exercises.

Cybersecurity Sales Professional
This is often overlooked, but cybersecurity sales professionals are responsible for selling cybersecurity solutions and services to organizations. There are typically two roles:

The salesperson who handles client relationships and negotiations
The sales engineer who does technical demos and explains how the solutions work
If you're not comfortable with tech, don't sweat it! The sales engineer role often involves doing demos of the same platform repeatedly, so you'll get comfortable with the tech just by virtue of repetition.

Here's the kicker: security sales professionals make bank. All the security sales people I talk to get an incredibly good regular annual salary, plus bonuses and commissions based on what they sell (which is often a lot in the current market). If money is what drives you, definitely don't sleep on security sales professional roles.

Where to Find Entry-Level Cybersecurity Jobs
One of my favorite tools for finding cybersecurity jobs is LinkedIn. You should have a good LinkedIn profile with your header, a professional photo, a brief description, your name, and a list of all the amazing things you've been doing to learn cybersecurity.

On LinkedIn, go to the job search, type in the job you want (like "GRC Analyst"), and use the filters to narrow it down to entry-level positions. You can also filter by remote work, industry, location – choose your own adventure.

You'll see there are many full-time, fully remote GRC jobs for someone with entry-level skills that are actively being recruited for right now. If you dig in a little bit, some might say "entry-level, 3-5 years of experience" – but remember, you can stack your experience. If you work somewhere in help desk or IT, reach out to the InfoSec department and say, "Hey, I'd love to help your mission. How can I help in my current role?" Worm your way in there and count that time as experience.

The Hidden Job Market
But here's the real gold: half of all jobs in cybersecurity, especially entry-level ones, never get posted. They're filled through word of mouth. I personally have connected multiple people with open jobs because someone will come to me and say, "Hey Gerald, I've got an opening, do you know anyone?" And I'll say, "Yeah, I know someone." Boom.

It saves the employer the time of posting a job, sorting through resumes, scheduling interviews – instead, they rely on trusted recommendations. That's how powerful networking is. My last three jobs? I didn't even interview for them. They literally called me and said, "Hey, I know you're working somewhere, but what would it take for you to quit and come work for us?" That's how powerful networking can be.

So invest in networking, even if it's uncomfortable. Join cybersecurity communities (the Simply Cyber Discord is a great place to start), attend local meetups, engage with professionals on LinkedIn, and start building those relationships. You'll be surprised how quickly you get acclimated and how transformative it can be for your career.

What You REALLY Need to Get Started in Cybersecurity
Depending on the skills you currently have and the field you're currently in, you may already have many of the skills needed to pivot into cybersecurity. You do not have to start from zero. You do not have to reboot your career. You do not have to start over.

You could be coming from marketing, pharmacy, mechanics, retail, teaching, parenting, heavy equipment operation – any background – and successfully pivot into cybersecurity. On the Simply Cyber YouTube channel, I've put together a host of videos capturing different pivot stories – real people who transitioned from various backgrounds into successful cybersecurity careers.

So what do you actually need? Here's the stripped-down truth:

A willingness to learn continuously - This industry changes constantly
Problem-solving ability - The essence of cybersecurity is solving complex problems
Communication skills - You'll need to explain technical concepts to non-technical people
Basic IT fundamentals - You can learn these through free resources if you don't have them
Some hands-on practice - Through labs, projects, or volunteer work
One relevant certification - Security+ is the gold standard for entry-level positions
Notice what's NOT on this list: a computer science degree, 5 years of experience, coding expertise, or intimate knowledge of every security tool. Those things can help, but they're not barriers to entry.
